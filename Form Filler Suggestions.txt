Ment for chrome browsers and is an add on from the chrome store

This is a downloadable form filler so you can fill your forms from anything
However it is a little more difficult as you can imagine how it tries to fill 
your forums from anywhere.


Another browser extension however for firefox

version.
It has the same principals as the chrome version however its added on from a 
firefox get addons section.
